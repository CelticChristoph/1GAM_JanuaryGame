Concepts:

-InfiRun_Set1
	Worm forest that gives a bit uncomfortable feeling.
	Player: Little girl running, (with a kitchen knife), after grown man, or tries to escape from a grown man.
	Obstacles: Roots, Ditches, Stumps, Fallen trees, Big branches.

-InfiRun_Set2
	Old and abandoned mansion.
	Player: A kid that didn't belie ghost stories who found out that he's wrong...
	Obstacles: Furniture, Armor, Sets, Bodies of other unfortunate adventures, Ghosts, Falling Chandeliers, Collapsed pillars/rooftops, Holes in the floor.
	Option: At some point changing surroundings to more confusing… Deeper down the rabbit hole, so to say.

-InfiRun_Set3
	Candy land; Aqueducts of Mountain Dew(or some other soft drink), mountains of frosting, jelly fields, candy cane forests.
	Player: Fat man running after delicious cupcake that keep escaping him (flying away).
	Obstacles: All sorts of candy, Chocolate stones, spikes of frosting, fallen candy canes, jelly pits.. something else…
	Twist: Upon death player is shown a cutscene, that shows that the man(player) is actually in a desert, implying that the whole nami nam land was a mirage. (easily to technically implement)

Personal opinion: Not sure what I'd personally want to do from these, all are interesting. Difficulty of making 'em differs though. 1 being easiest and 3 hardest.

Open to all suggestions (new settings as well, I'd ask, though, to implement some kind of story, it's more interesting that way.)

Over and out. Alex.

Celtic's Opinion:

Honsetly, just like I figured I would, I love them all. To be honest, I hope at some point during the next twelve months we can find a way to implement all of these ideas.

However, that being said, for this particular project, I think I honestly like the idea of Setting 1 best. 
The idea is just the most intriguing to me, and I think that if we do it right, the game could be pretty sweet to be honest.

As far as whether she's chasing or running... personally I like the idea of her running away better. It's hard to find compelling reasons that a young girl would be chasing someone with a knife.
Also I think that it makes the idea of a lot of the traps seem more "real". If the girl was the one doing the chasing, wouldn't she know about the traps, etc?

Call me a goofball I guess, but thoughts like that can really keep me from enjoying a game if the logic doesn't follow.

But, yeah. All of the ideas are great, and I wouldn't be mad about having to use any of them!

Thanks for the feedback, mate.

Was halfdead while writing all of it, logic might be missing there at some points :D
You're right, running away is a better option there *has a brief vision of death cutscene, 1s long, just enough to get the message through*

Will be waiting for Patrick's opinion while trying to figure out more about how Slick2D can handle textures.
