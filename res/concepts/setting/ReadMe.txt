Concepts:

-InfiRun_Set1
	Worm forest that gives a bit uncomfortable feeling.
	Player: Little girl running, (with a kitchen knife), after grown man, or tries to escape from a grown man.
	Obstacles: Roots, Ditches, Stumps, Fallen trees, Big branches.

-InfiRun_Set2
	Old and abandoned mansion.
	Player: A kid that didn't belie ghost stories who found out that he's wrong...
	Obstacles: Furniture, Armor, Sets, Bodies of other unfortunate adventures, Ghosts, Falling Chandeliers, Collapsed pillars/rooftops, Holes in the floor.
	Option: At some point changing surroundings to more confusing… Deeper down the rabbit hole, so to say.

-InfiRun_Set3
	Candy land; Aqueducts of Mountain Dew(or some other soft drink), mountains of frosting, jelly fields, candy cane forests.
	Player: Fat man running after delicious cupcake that keep escaping him (flying away).
	Obstacles: All sorts of candy, Chocolate stones, spikes of frosting, fallen candy canes, jelly pits.. something else…
	Twist: Upon death player is shown a cutscene, that shows that the man(player) is actually in a desert, implying that the whole nami nam land was a mirage. (easily to technically implement)

Personal opinion. Not sure what I'd personally wan to do from these, all are interesting. Difficulty of making 'em differs though. 1 being easiest and 3 hardest.

Open to all suggestions (new settings as well, I'd ask, though, to implement some kind of story, it's more interesting that way.)

Over and out. Alex.
